# About

Our overarching aim with the project was to create developer tools with an amazing user experience. This means the tools should not require large infrastructure to run and should be usable on developer laptops. They should generate portable outputs that can be shared between developers and they should have a progressive approach to information display where the fine detail is only provided if you want it.
